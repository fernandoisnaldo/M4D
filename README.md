Mobile for desktop

Repository created as a proof of concept, with the goal of being a prototype for a program for both Windows and Linux.

The goal is to create a mobile launcher that can run on Windows and any Linux distribution on a 5-inch touch screen, like smartphones, without having to create a window manager or graphical interface (like Plasma Mobile, Phosh) just for that..

A similar example of this goal is what has already been successfully implemented in the Steam Deck, which is a game launcher for portable consoles that runs on a complete operating system with a desktop environment.


I personally will not develop this project to a functional stage, but it will serve as an idea for those who want to free us from the shackles of the imperialist big techs of the United States of America.
